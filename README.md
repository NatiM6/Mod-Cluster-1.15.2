# Mod Cluster 1.15.2
My collection of Minecraft 1.15.2 mods in one big clustermess. Or a little clustermess, I'm not that committed.

It mostly a playing ground so you won't find anything of value here.
~~You can steal everything to your heart's content.~~ It wasn't possible until I've added a license, but now it's still not, I guess.
If you actually do find anything useful, congratulations, and thank you for appreciation.

Any 1.15.2 modding tutorials are welcome.
